                    <h3>Definition</h3>
                    <p>
                        The idea that Asian and/or Asian Americans are more successful because we "overcame" the challenges
                        of immigrating to a new country and assimilating to mainstream culture and reached socio-economic success.

                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Purpose of the myth</h3>
                    <p>This myth was designed to discredit Black struggles by implying that Black people need to work harder.
                    This caused a big division between Asian and Black communities.
                    <br>White americans are saying "if Asians can do it, why can't Black people do the same?"
                    <br>
                    Basically, White Americans did not want to take responsibility for the past, present, and future effects of racism that they caused.
                    Embodiment of "Haters turn into your friends" to put others below them. </p>
